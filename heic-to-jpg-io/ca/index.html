                No. Conversion happens entirely on your device. The app uses

              <p>
                HEIC (based on HEIF) can store photos at smaller sizes than JPG
                while keeping high quality. Many apps still prefer JPG, so
                conversion is common.

                Yes. Add multiple HEIC/HEIF files and the tool will process them

          <h2>HEIC to JPG in Canada: a practical guide for fast, private conversion</h2>
          <p>
            If you have photos from an iPhone or a newer device, there’s a good
            chance they are saved as <strong>HEIC</strong> (or <strong>HEIF</strong>)
            instead of <strong>JPG</strong>. HEIC is efficient and modern, but it
            can be inconvenient when you need maximum compatibility. Many
            websites, apps, printers, and older operating systems still expect
            JPEG files, and “just uploading” a HEIC image often fails or strips
            previews. A reliable HEIC to JPG converter solves that problem by
            producing a standard JPEG that works almost everywhere.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>heic-to-jpg.io</strong> is designed as a single-page tool with
            performance and stability in mind. The UI renders skeleton result
            cards immediately (to keep the layout stable), then performs
            conversion sequentially in a Web Worker. That approach keeps the main
            thread responsive and reduces the chance of memory spikes on mobile.
            Most importantly, the conversion happens <strong>client-side</strong>:
            your files are processed on your device, not uploaded to a server.
          </p>

          <h3>What is HEIC / HEIF?</h3>
          <p>
            HEIF (High Efficiency Image File Format) is a container format for
            images and image sequences. HEIC is a common HEIF variant used for
            single photos. Apple popularized HEIC on iOS because it can store
            high-quality images at smaller file sizes than JPEG. Internally, many
            HEIC photos use a modern video codec (HEVC/H.265) to compress still
            images efficiently. This can be great for storage, but it also means
            that some systems need extra components or decoders to read HEIC
            images correctly.
          </p>
          <p>
            You may see HEIC/HEIF in situations like: importing iPhone photos to a
            Windows PC, attaching images to email clients, uploading to older CMS
            systems, or dropping photos into software that only accepts JPG/PNG.
            Converting to JPG is usually the simplest compatibility fix, because
            JPEG decoding is universally supported across browsers and devices.
          </p>

          <h3>Why convert HEIC to JPG?</h3>
          <p>
            Converting HEIC to JPG is useful when you want an image format that:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Uploads reliably to forms and web apps that don’t accept HEIC.</li>
            <li>Opens in older photo editors, office apps, or print workflows.</li>
            <li>Is easier to share with people on mixed devices (Android/Windows/macOS).</li>
            <li>Works in third-party services that generate thumbnails from JPG.</li>
            <li>Fits into automation pipelines that expect “.jpg” extensions.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            While PNG is also widely compatible, JPG is usually the better target
            for photos (smaller output, ideal for gradients and natural images).
            JPG does not support transparency, but HEIC photos typically don’t
            need it. For standard camera photos, converting to JPEG is the most
            practical option.
          </p>

          <h3>How this browser-based HEIC to JPG converter works</h3>
          <p>
            The conversion pipeline is intentionally interaction-driven. The page
            loads with minimal JavaScript so it can be fast and stable. When you
            add HEIC files, the app creates result “cards” immediately, then
            lazy-loads the heavy decoding runtime and ZIP utilities. HEIC decoding
            is performed with WebAssembly, and conversion runs inside a dedicated
            Web Worker. By doing decoding off the main thread, the UI stays
            responsive while each file is processed one at a time.
          </p>
          <p>
            After decoding a HEIC image to raw RGBA pixels, the converter encodes
            the result as a JPEG using a canvas encoder. The app then creates an
            Object URL for preview and revokes URLs on reset to avoid memory leaks.
            This object URL lifecycle management is especially important on
            mobile browsers, where holding many large previews can cause crashes
            or tab reloads.
          </p>

          <h3>Quality settings: file size vs. detail</h3>
          <p>
            JPEG is a lossy format. That means the “quality” setting affects the
            output size and visual detail. Higher quality produces larger files
            and preserves more texture, while lower quality reduces file size at
            the cost of compression artifacts. For most photos, a quality range
            of <strong>75 to 85</strong> is a good balance. Use higher values for
            print, professional editing, or images with sharp edges and text. Use
            lower values when you need smaller files for web uploads or messaging.
          </p>
          <p>
            This tool’s global quality slider applies to files that are still
            pending in the queue. You can also override quality per image using
            the settings button on a card. That lets you keep most images at an
            efficient size while preserving extra quality for a few important
            photos.
          </p>

          <h3>EXIF metadata: keep it or remove it</h3>
          <p>
            Many photos contain EXIF metadata such as camera model, exposure,
            timestamp, and sometimes GPS location. Keeping EXIF can be useful if
            you rely on photo dates, lens information, or editing apps that read
            metadata. On the other hand, removing metadata can be better for
            privacy, especially if you’re sharing images publicly. This converter
            includes a “keep EXIF” toggle as a best-effort option: when metadata
            can be extracted from the HEIC container and safely inserted into the
            output JPEG, it will be preserved. If not, conversion still succeeds
            and you get a clean JPEG.
          </p>

          <h3>Batch conversion and ZIP downloads</h3>
          <p>
            If you have dozens of iPhone photos to convert, bulk processing saves
            time. Add multiple files at once and let the app process them
            sequentially. As each image completes, the preview updates and an
            individual download button becomes available. When the batch is
            finished, the “Download all (.zip)” button is enabled. The ZIP is
            generated only when you click download, which avoids unnecessary CPU
            work and keeps the page responsive during conversion.
          </p>

          <h3>Troubleshooting HEIC conversion</h3>
          <p>
            If a HEIC file fails to convert, it’s often due to one of a few common
            reasons. Some HEIF containers include image sequences (for example,
            burst shots or Live Photo derivatives). This tool converts the primary
            image by default. A file may also be partially corrupted (incomplete
            transfer), or it may use features that are not supported by a given
            decoder build. Try re-exporting the original photo, downloading it
            again, or converting fewer files at once on memory-constrained
            devices. If a file is detected as non-HEIC, ensure the extension is
            .heic or .heif and that your browser isn’t stripping MIME types.
          </p>
          <p>
            For the best results, use a modern browser. If you’re on a phone and
            the tab reloads mid-conversion, reduce the batch size and let the
            sequential worker finish a few files at a time. The converter is built
            to fail safely: errors are shown on the affected card and the queue
            continues, so one problematic file does not stop the entire batch.
